# Understanding Check

In the `Understanding.java` file, lines 3 through 5 are asking you to do something similar to the initial try from the homework. Try to match a data type to the partial variable declarations. Each variable is being assigned a value, but doesn't have it's data type written at the beginning of the line like it's supposed to, can you fill in the correct type?

For lines 6 through 8, the variables have a type, but are missing an assigned value on the other side. Can you write in values that meet the requirements of the data type for each line? Try to make them unique from the values in the variables from lines 3 through 5. Also, make all of these variable so that they won't be able to be edited later.

Your goal is the eliminate the errors (highlighted in red) and instead ensure there is only warnings (highlighted in yellow), as that means there are no data type issues, just issues with the variables not being used further.

Once you have gotten to just warnings, save the Java file and commit and push your changes via GitHub Desktop.
