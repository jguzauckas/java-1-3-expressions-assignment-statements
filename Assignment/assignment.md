# Assignment

Using the starting sample code in the `Assignment.java` file, try to match a data type to the partial variable declarations.

Each variable is being assigned a value, but doesn't have it's data type written at the beginning of the line like it's supposed to, can you fill in the correct type?

Your goal is the eliminate the errors (highlighted in red) and instead ensure there is only warnings (highlighted in yellow), as that means there are no data type issues, just issues with the variables not being used further.

Once you have gotten to just warnings, save the Java file and commit and push your changes via GitHub Desktop.
