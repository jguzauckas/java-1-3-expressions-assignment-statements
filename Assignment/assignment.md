# Assignment

Using the starting sample code in the `Assignment.java` file, try to create the variables described below:

- Create an integer variable named `wholeNumber` that has the value `17`
- Create a double variable named `decimalNumber` that has the value `-4.367`
- Create a boolean variable named `booleanValue` that has the value `false`
- One one line, create an integer variable named `wholeNumberAgain`. On the next line, assign it the value of the result of 5 plus 3

Use print statements to print what you calculate to be the result of each of the following compound expressions:

- `5 + 3 - 4 / 6 * 2`
- `4.2 % 3 - (7.3 * 4)`

Once you have gotten to just warnings (no errors, the file can run without issues), save the Java file and commit and push your changes via GitHub Desktop.
