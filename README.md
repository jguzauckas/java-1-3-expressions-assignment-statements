# AP Computer Science A - Chapter 1 Section 3

# Expressions and Assignment Statements

This third section is meant to continue outlining some basics that will be critical as we look to begin building our core knowledge of Java.

Due to the nature of Java, certain elements of a Java program are going to be taken for granted and ultimately ignored as we work with the basics, but are required for the program to run successfully. I encourage you to read them and start to internalize them as they'll become a key aspect of the work we do as the year goes on.

This section covers the following material:

- Literal Values
- Variable Declaration, Initialization, and Assignment
- Arithmetic Operations and Expressions
- Operator Precedence
- Arithmetic Problems

To use this repository, start with the `notes.md` document, referencing the various `.java` documents as you go to see the examples in action.

Once you have completed the assignment, save the Java files and commit and push your changes via GitHub Desktop.
